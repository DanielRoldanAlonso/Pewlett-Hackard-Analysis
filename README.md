# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview

The purpose of this analysis was to determine the number of retiring emeployees per title and identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program. After, we wrote a report to summarize our analysis and provide more insight on the "silver tsunami". This is all to help prepare Bobby's manager as many current employees reach retirment age. 

## Results
- From our table below, it is clear that the most amount of employees that have reached the retirment age are those in a senior position.
- From our table below, managers have the lowest amount of employees at the retirement age by a substiantial amount. This is surpising as they probably have a higher ranking than staff, engineers, or assistants to roles. 
- From our table below, there are more than 72,000 employees that have reached the retirment age

## Summary
As the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact, a total of 72,000 employees will be eligable to retire. For the most part, from our first table above in the results, it is important to focus on senior positioned roles. The senior engineers and senior staff take more than half of the retired age population within the company. Unfortunately, only having 1,500 employees on a mentorship program will not be sufficient to replace these senior leaders. This is a situation of great urgency as from our analysis, we did not check for those employees titles. So they might not even be eligible for a future senior engineer and staffing position. However, there are enough qualified, retriment-ready employees to mentor the next generation.
