# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview

The purpose of this analysis was to determine the number of retiring emeployees per title and identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program. After, we wrote a report to summarize our analysis and provide more insight on the "silver tsunami". This is all to help prepare Bobby's manager as many current employees reach retirment age. 

## Results
- From our table below, it is clear that the most amount of employees that have reached the retirment age are those in a senior position.
- From our table below, managers have the lowest amount of employees at the retirement age by a substiantial amount. This is surpising as they probably have a higher ranking than staff, engineers, or assistants to roles. 
- From our table below, there are more than 72,000 employees that have reached the retirment age
